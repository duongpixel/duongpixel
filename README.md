- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @duongpixel
- ğŸ‘€ I am currently working as a 3d furniture modeler and collaborating with a number of other architectural and game units.
- ğŸŒ± Previously I studied network administration and network security for 3 years and I was not interested in that so I switched to positions I liked more.
